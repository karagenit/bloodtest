# bloodtest

Let's say we have a population of N = 10,000, and we want to find each individual with a certain trait T. This trait has a likelihood of occurrence of P = 0.01, so E(T) = 100 in our population. Assuming we can group individuals together and test them as a pool, what is the most efficient grouping structure to reduce the # of tests required?
